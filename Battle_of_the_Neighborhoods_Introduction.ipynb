    "1) Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common businesses is that of a restaurant. There are many reasons why this is the case, chief among these is that it is an easy business to get into. The qualifications for opening a restaurant are low. As long as an individual could scrape together the necessary funds, he/she could open a new restaurants. This is one reason why so many immigrants open restaurants. For this project, I am assuming that the client is interested in finding a good Toronto neighborhood to open a Japanese restaurant in.\n",

    "2) Business Problem\n",
    "While it is not difficult to set up a restaurant, it is not easy to successfully run one. As any real estate agent will be quick to say, the three most important variables in having a successful venture is location, location, location. The client can serve fantastic Japanese food and provide unparalleled service but the restaurant may still fail if it is in a poor location. For instance, the client may face an uphill battle if the restaurant in a neighborhood with many similar restaurants. Armed with the knowledge that a good location is vital to the success of the client's venture, I will analyze Toronto's geographic data to find an ideal neighborhood for the hypothetical client's new Japanese restaurant."
